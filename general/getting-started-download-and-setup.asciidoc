= Download and Setup

In this section, you will learn how to setup the devonfw environment and start working on first project based on devonfw.

The devonfw environment contains all software and tools necessary to develop the applications with devonfw.

== Prerequisites

In order to setup the environment, following are the prerequisites:

* Internet connection (including details of your proxy configuration, if necessary)
* 2GB of free disk space
* The ZIP containing the latest devonfw distribution

== Download
The devonfw distributions can be obtained from the http://de-mucevolve02/files/devonfw/[FTP releases library] and are packaged in a _zip_ file that includes all the needed tools, software and configurations. Browse to the **current** folder in order to get the latest version.

.*Using devcon*
[NOTE]
You can do it using devcon with the command `devon dist install`, learn more  <<dist install,here>>.
After a successful installation, you can initialize it with the command `devon dist init`, learn more <<dist init,here>>.

== Setup the workspace

1. Unzip the devonfw distribution into a directory of your choice. *The path to the devonfw distribution directory should contain no spaces*, to prevent problems with some of the tools.

1. Run the batch file "create-or-update-workspace.bat".

This will configure the included tools like Eclipse with the default settings of the devonfw distribution.

The result should be as seen below

[start=3]

*The working devonfw environment is ready!!!*

*Note* : If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you have to manually configure it in Maven, Sencha Cmd and Eclipse. Next section explains about it.

== Setup the workspace (Linux)

* Unzip the devonfw distribution into a directory of your choice. *The path to the devonfw distribution directory should contain no spaces*, to prevent problems with some of the tools.

* Run the script: . env.sh

* Run the script: . create-or-update-workspace

image::images/download-install/create_update_ws.png[, width="550", create_update_ws, link="images/download-install/create_update_ws.png"]

These both . env.sh and . create-or-update-workspace will set all the softwares path that included with devon distribution like eclipse, maven , java etc. Also this will generate some file like eclipse_main used to invoke eclipse

* For vscode setup we have to execute create-or-update-workspace-vs

* There are a script initialize.sh and uninstallUI.sh . These scripts are for installing/uninstalling angular,node, python etc

=== Manual Tool Configuration
==== Maven

Open the file "conf/.m2/settings.xml" in an editor

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_3_proxy_maven.png[, width="450", link="images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_3_proxy_maven.png"]

Remove the comment tags around the <proxy> section at the beginning of the file.

Then update the settings to match your proxy configuration.

If your proxy does not require authentication, simply remove the <username> and <password> lines.

==== Sencha Cmd

Open the file software/Sencha/Cmd/default/sencha.cfg in an editor

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_5_proxy_sencha.png[, width="450", link="images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_5_proxy_sencha.png"]

Search for the property definition of "cmd.jvm.args" (around line 45).

Comment the existing property definition and uncomment the line above it.

Then update the settings to match your proxy configuration.

If your proxy does not require authentication, simply remove the "-Dhttp.proxyUser", "-DhttpProxyPassword", "-Dhttps.proxyUser" and "-Dhttps.proxyPassword" parameters.

==== Eclipse

Open eclipse by executing "eclipse-main.bat".

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_7_proxy_eclipse.png[, width="350", link="images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_7_proxy_eclipse.png"]

In the Eclipse preferences dialog, go to "General - Network Connection".

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_8_proxy_eclipse.png[, width="450", link="images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_8_proxy_eclipse.png"]

Switch from "Native" to "Manual"

Enter your proxy configuration
