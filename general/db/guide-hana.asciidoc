= SAP HANA

This section contains hints for those who use https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html[SAP HANA], a very powerful and fast RDBMS. Besides general hints about the driver there are tips for more tight integration with other SAP features or products.

== Java

=== Driver
SAP Hana is a commercial and professional product.
However, the hana JDBC driver is available in Maven Central what makes it easy to integrate.
All you need is the following maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sap.cloud.db.jdbc</groupId>
  <artifactId>ngdbc</artifactId>
  <version>${hana.driver.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
Of course the version (`${hana.driver.version}`) needs to be adopted to your needs (Hana installtion in production, e.g. `2.4.64`).
For an overview of available driver versions see https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.cloud.db.jdbc/ngdbc/[here].
