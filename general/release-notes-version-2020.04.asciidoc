== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 2020.04. This version is the first one with the new versioning that will make easier to the community to identify when it was released since we use the year and month as many other software distributions.

* New devon4j authorization of batches feature.
* Dozer replaced with Orika in devon4j.  
* Support for composite keys in devon4j and CobiGen.
* Multiple enhancements for project specific plugin development and usage of project specific template sets in CobiGen.
* Ability to adapt your own templates by making use of CobiGen CLI.
* Better responsiveness in eclipse and bugfixes in all assets in CobiGen.
* devon4ng updated to Angular 9, NgRx 9 and Ionic 5, including documentation, samples and templates.
* Yarn 2 support in devon4ng.
* devon4node updated to NestJS 7 (packages, samples and documentation)
