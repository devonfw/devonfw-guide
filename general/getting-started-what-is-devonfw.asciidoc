= devonfw Introduction

image::images/devonfw-small.png[,align="center",width="200",devonfw, link="images/devonfw-small.png"]

Welcome to *devonfw*, the Devon Framework. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.

http://devonfw.github.io/index.html[Devon framework] is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

== Building Blocks of the Platform

devonfw uses a state-of-the-art open source core reference architecture for the server (today considered as commodity in the IT-industry) and on top of it an ever increasing number of high-value assets that are developed by Capgemini.

== devonfw Technology Stack

devonfw is composed of an Open Source part that can be freely used by other people and proprietary addons which are Capgemini IP and can be used only in Capgemini engagements.The Open Source part of devonfw is called _The Open Application Standard Platform_ (OASP) . It consist of

=== Back-end solutions

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[_devon4j_]: server implemented with Java. The OASP platform provides an implementation for Java based on https://spring.io/[Spring] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot].

- https://github.com/oasp/oasp4fn[_OASP4FN_]: serverless implementation based on https://nodejs.org/en/[node.js].

- _Dot Net_ implementation. (Upcoming)

=== Front-end solutions

For client applications, _devonfw_ includes two possible solutions based on _JavaScript_:

- https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-ng-project-seed[OASP4JS]: the _OASP_ implementation based on https://angular.io/[Angular] framework.

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4sencha[devon4sencha]: a client solution based on the https://www.sencha.com/[Sencha] framework.

Check out the links for more details.

== Custom Tools

=== Pre-installed Software

- _Eclipse_: pre-configured and fully functional IDE to develop Java based apps.

- _Java_: all the Java environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Maven_: to manage project dependencies.

- _Node_: a Node js environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Sencha_: devonfw also includes a installation of the _Sencha Cmd_ tool.

- _Sonarqube_: a code quality tool.

- _Tomcat_: a web server ready to test the deploy of our artifacts.

=== Devcon

For project management and other life-cycle related tasks, _devonfw_ provides also https://github.com/devonfw/devcon[Devcon], a command line and graphic user interface cross platform tool.

With _Devcon_, users can automate the creation of new projects (both server and client), build and run those and even, for server projects, deploy locally on Tomcat.

All those tasks can be done manually using _Maven_, _Tomcat_, _Sencha Cmd_, _Bower_, _Gulp_, etc. but with _Devcon_ users have the possibility of managing the projects without the necessity of dealing with all those different tools.

=== Cobigen

_Cobigen_ is a code generator included in the context of _devonfw_ that allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time wasted in repetitive tasks.

== devonfw Modules

As a part of the goal of productivity boosting, _devonfw_ also provides a set of _modules_ to the developers, created from real projects requirements, that can be connected to projects for saving all the work of a new implementation.

The current available modules are:

- _async_: module to manage asynchronous web calls in a _Spring_ based server app.

- _i18n_: module for internationalization.

- _integration_: implementation of https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[_Spring Integration_].

- _microservices_: a set of archetypes to create a complete microservices infrastructure based on https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/[_Spring Cloud_Netflix].

- _reporting_: a module to create reports based on http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library[_Jasper Reports_] library.

- _winauth active directory_: a module to authenticate users against an _Active Directory_.

- _winauth single sign on_: module that allows applications to authenticate the users by the Windows credentials.
